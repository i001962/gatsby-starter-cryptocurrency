          <strong>Catalyst</strong> utilizes <strong>Argon2/CHUKWA</strong> a{' '}
          <strong>CryptoNote</strong> application layer protocol-based algorithm, that powers
          several decentralized privacy-oriented digital currencies. It aims to be an evolution of
          the ideas behind <strong>Bitcoin. </strong>Another <strong>significant difference</strong>{' '}
          is <strong>CryptoNote's</strong> hash-based proof-of-work algorithm. Bitcoin uses{' '}
          <strong>SHA-256</strong>, which is a <strong>CPU-bound function</strong>. That means that
          participants (miners) are only limited by their calculation speeds, and it is relatively
          cheap to create an application-specific integrated circuit <strong>(ASIC)</strong> device,
          which will surpass an ordinary computer in hashes per unit of money.{' '}
          <strong>CryptoNote</strong> uses <strong>memory bound</strong> function CryptoNight, which
          cannot be easily pipelined.
